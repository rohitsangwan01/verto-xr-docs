# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with VertoXR and understand the basic app usage.

## Modes

### Free Mode

Add and arrange multiple displays freely. Windows are movable by default using the mouse.

### Fixed Mode

Displays follow a predefined setup. To move them, enable the checkbox in the ArSpace menu (this will be enabled by default in an upcoming version 0.0.4+).

## Controls

### Movement

- **WASD**: Move in AR space
- **Head Movement**: Move your head for 3DOF experience

### Display Manipulation

- **Move Displays**: Hold the display in ArSpace with left mouse button and drag
- **Rotate Displays**: Hold the display in ArSpace with right mouse button and drag
- **Alternative Control**: Hold displays with left/right mouse button and use WASD

## Navigation

### Entering Displays

- **Enter a Display**: Click on display from ArSpace to enter in it

### Exiting Displays

- **Exit to ArSpace**: Use the middle mouse button or the Global Hotkey to exit back to ArSpace

## Important Notes

- **Display Switching**: Moving from one display to another display is not supported yet, as those displays might not be arranged properly in OS display settings. This will be implemented in upcoming updates. To move to another display, move back to ArSpace and enter another display.

- **Saving Setups**: Saving a display setup will be added in upcoming version.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basic controls and navigation, you can start exploring VertoXR and setting up your virtual workspace!
